# This Patch sets the hostname of the machine. This is needed
# for FRR to work properly (MetalLB uses FRR to announce).
# Currently, the hostname is set to the machine_name.${SECRET_DOMAIN},
# So each one is different. On next deploy, let's try setting them
# statically via the server class.

  path: /machine/network/hostname
